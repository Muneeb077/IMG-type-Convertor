# IMG-type-Convertor

##Overview:

This Python script is designed to convert JPEG images to PNG format. It takes two command-line arguments: the path to the folder containing the JPEG images (image_folder) and the path to the folder where the converted images will be saved (output_folder).

##Functionality:

The script performs the following tasks:

- Checks if the output folder exists. If not, it creates the folder.
- Iterates through the specified image folder.
- Converts each JPEG image to PNG format.
- Saves the converted images in the output folder.

##Note:

- Ensure that all the JPEG images are located in the specified image_folder.
- The script will create the output folder if it does not already exist.
